Lab:
===
Section 1 :: Create a partition of 100 MB. Create an extended partition and assign rest of the disk space to it.
             Create a logical partition of 1 GB

Section 2 :: Format the primary partition using xfs filesystem and mount it under /mnt/primary
             Format the logical partition using ex4 filesystem and mount it under /mnt/logical

Linux native filesystems ==> ext2 / ext3 / ext4 / xfs [ default filesystem in RHEL7/RHEL8 ] 


Command (m for help): p [ to list the partitions available in the partition table ]
 Command (m for help): n [ create a new partition ]
  First Sector : <Press Enter>
  Last Sector : +100M
 Command (m for help): q [ to quit from fdisk ]
 Command (m for help): w [ to save ]
 Command (m for help): d [ to delete a partition ]
 Exit from fdisk utility.
 
 Run the udevadm settle command to register the changes means mkaing the system wait to detect the new partition
 and to create the associated device file under /dev/directory.

  For RHEL6/RHEL7 ==> partprobe /dev/sdb

Create Filesystem on the partition
  mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
  mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb5

Create mount point directories
  mkdir /mnt/{primary,logical}

Mount the partitions
  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/primary
  mount /dev/sdb5 /mnt/logical

Mount partitions persistently so that it remains mounted across reboot
	vim /etc/fstab
 Device/Partition   Mount_Point     Filesystem     Mount_Options     Dump_Level      FSCK_Order
  /dev/sdb1	    /mnt/primary     xfs            defaults            0                0
Save and Quit
mount -a

 Note: It is recommended that we use the UUID value for the partition instead of using the device name
UUID="4ebd0de5-fe18-4d3f-b109-6ef1a3af19c9"		/mnt/primary		xfs	defaults	0 0
To get the UUID value, run the blkid command ==> blkid /dev/sdb1

A swap space is an area os a disk under the control of the Linux kernel memory management subsystem.
The combined system RAM plus swap space is called Virtual Memory.

Steps to create Swap Partition
1. Create a partition of 1 GB and change the partition ID from 83 to 82 to make it a Linux Swap Partition
    Linux Native Filesystem(ext2/ext3/ext4/xfs) ==> 83
    Linux Swap ==> 82
    Linux LVM  ==> 8e
    Linux RAID ==> fd
2. Format the SWAP partition
    mkswap /dev/sdb6   ==> The mkswap command applies a swap signature to the device. It writes a single block of
    data at the beginning of the device, leaving the rest of the device unformatted so that kernel can use it to store    memory pages.
	mkswap /dev/sdb6
3. Activate the SWAP partition
	swapon /dev/sdb6
        swapoff /dev/sdb6 [ to deactivate swap partition ]
4. Make the SWAP partition persistent across reboot

 Device/Partition   Mount_Point     Filesystem     Mount_Options     Dump_Level      FSCK_Order
   /dev/sdb6	      swap            swap            defaults          0               0

5. To check the status swap partition - 
	swapon -s
	swapon -v
