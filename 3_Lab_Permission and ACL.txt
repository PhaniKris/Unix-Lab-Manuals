Lab : Configure permissions and ACL 
----------------------------------
1. Create a group called cloudadmins with GID 10001
2. Create a user called cloud-user1 using the following specifications - 
	UID = 10001
	GECOS Field = Cloud Operator
	Secondary Group = cloudadmins
	Default Shell = /bin/sh
3. cloud-user1 should be configured as to run any command within the system. After this configuration is done the following
   commmand should run successfully - 
	su - cloud-user1
	tail -n 5 /var/log/messages
4. As cloud-user1, attempt to make a copy of /etc/fstab as /etc/fstab without using sudo. This should fail.
5. Setup a message of the day(motd) as "Today we have meeting with V.P @5 PM". This message should be displayed before
   the actual login happens.
6. If the /etc/passwd file is deleted accidentally, how do you restore that?
7. Create a directory called /shares/content.
8. cloudadmins should be the group owner for /shares/content directory.
9. cloudadmins group members should have full access and others should have read and execute permission on /shares/content directory. Any files/directories created withn this directory should have the group owner set as cloudadmin automaically. Ensure that only owners can delete his/her file(s) within /shares/content directory.
10. Create a user called architect1 who should have read and write access on /shares/content directory.
11. Copy the file /etc/inittab within /var/tmp directory.
12. /var/tmp/inittab file should have the owner as root 
13. /var/tmp/inittab file should have the group owner as root
14. cloud-user1 should have read and write access on /var/tmp/inittab
15. architect1 user should have no access on /var/tmp/inittab
16. Any other user should have read access for the /var/tmp/inittab file.
17. Setup a default ACL on /shares/content directory so that any new files/directories created within that get     the same ACL as that of the directory.
18. Filter the lines from /etc/passwd file which have the word called "root" and store the filtered output in a    file called /root/filter.txt
